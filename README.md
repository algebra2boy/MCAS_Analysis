# What is this about:

This research explores the relationship between explore the relationship between household income and standardized test performance. Our interest is in investigating how demographic predictors correspond to test results. The achievement gap is a prominent and ongoing socio-economic issue within education, so we expect our analysis to support the hypothesis that lower mean family income is correlated with lower MCAS scores and SAT scores.
